Sample Script for Spitting Records for NYU
```
## Use this script to take a single .JSON file that has many individual JSON records, split them into single files that are nested within the file-folder structure that NYU uses for OpenGeoMetadata.

require 'json'

irb_context.echo = false

nyu_file = File.read('/Users/andrewbattista/Downloads/UAE_complete_metadata_singlefile.json')

## The file where the original .json that contains all of the records is above. Make sure to include the full path

parsed_nyu = JSON.parse(nyu_file)

## The JSON.parse function parses the single file into discrete outputs as JSON files

parsed_nyu.each do |record|
  folder_name = record['layer_slug_s']
  dir1 = record['layer_slug_s'][4..7]
  dir2 = record['layer_slug_s'][9]
  dir3 = record['layer_slug_s'][10..11]
  dir4 = record['layer_slug_s'][12..13]

## This defines variables that correspond to the text string of the layer_slug_s element

  full_folder = "/Users/andrewbattista/Desktop/edu.nyu/handle"

  `mkdir -p #{full_folder}/#{dir1}/#{dir2}/#{dir3}/#{dir4}`

  ## This command above runs a unix command to make new folders according to the naming convention laid out from the named variables above

  File.open("#{full_folder}/#{dir1}/#{dir2}/#{dir3}/#{dir4}/geoblacklight.json", "w") do |f|

  ## We are opening a file that doesn't yet exist, giving it a name before it comes into being, and that name is the value full_folder/geoblacklight.json. Then it writes that to a file.

    f.write(JSON.pretty_generate(record))
  end

end
```

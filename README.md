# SDR Documentation

This repository is *the* place for documentation relevant to NYU's [Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu) and the parts of NYU Libraries infrastructure used to maintain it.

> **As of Fall 2023, this repo is being pruned and reorganized as part of a major SDR upgrade sprint; old documentation will be available in the `archive` branch, and only docs vetted as currently correct and useful will make their way to `main`. (WiP)**

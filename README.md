This repository is a place for documents detailing workflows, architecture, useful tools, and pieces of code relevant to NYU's [Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu) and the parts of NYU Libraries infrastructure used to maintain it. It was originally created by: Stephen Balogh, Andrew Battista, Karen Majewicz, Taylor Hixson.

As of Fall 2023, this repo is being pruned and reorganized as part of a major SDR upgrade sprint; Old documentation will be archived in the `archive` branch, and only docs vetted as correct and relevant will make their way to `main`. (WiP)
